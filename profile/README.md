# molstacklabs

**Open Source AI agents and UIs that make bio and chem data actually usable.**

MolStackLabs builds conversational and visual interfaces on top of outdated scientific tooling. We target biology and chemistry workflows â€” wrapping them with clean, intelligent, modular systems.

## ðŸ§  Why This Exists

Most scientific tools are:
- hard to use
- visually broken
- locked behind command-line expertise

We fix that by:
- creating **chat-based interfaces** for scientific data
- building **modern UIs** over ancient tools
- exposing complex workflows as **usable APIs**
